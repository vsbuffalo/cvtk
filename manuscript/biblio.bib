              co-inheritance of linked loci as they are transmitted across
              generations in both experimental and natural populations.
              However, in the age of whole-genome sequences, physical distances
              measured in base pairs of DNA provide the standard coordinates
              for navigating the myriad features of genomes. Although genetic
              and physical maps are colinear, there are well-characterized and
              sometimes dramatic heterogeneities in the average frequency of
              meiotic recombination events that occur along the physical extent
              of chromosomes. There also are documented differences in the
              recombination landscape between the two sexes. We have revisited
              high-resolution genetic map data from a large heterogeneous mouse
              population and have constructed a revised genetic map of the
              mouse genome, incorporating 10,195 single nucleotide
              polymorphisms using a set of 47 families comprising 3546 meioses.
              The revised map provides a different picture of recombination in
              the mouse from that reported previously. We have further
              integrated the genetic and physical maps of the genome and
              incorporated SSLP markers from other genetic maps into this new
              framework. We demonstrate that utilization of the revised genetic
              map improves QTL mapping, partially due to the resolution of
              previously undetected errors in marker ordering along the

  abstract  = "Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data
               to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent
               adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of
               positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it
               arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental
               changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or
               deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect
               this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked
               neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive
               directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a
               neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at
               frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation.
               Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large
               variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage
               disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for
               intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a
               loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the
               signature of directional selection currently relied on by

              genetic variation remains controversial. This is in part due to
              the limited evidence in humans for classic ``hard selective
              sweeps'', wherein a novel beneficial mutation rapidly sweeps
              through a population to fixation. However, positive selection may
              often proceed via ``soft sweeps'' acting on mutations already
              present within a population. Here, we examine recent positive
              selection across six human populations using a powerful machine

              We found evidence that soft sweeps are widespread and account for
              the vast majority of recent human adaptation. Surprisingly, our

              selective sweep, in which a single adaptive haplotype rises to
              high population frequency, in a soft selective sweep multiple
              adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously,
              producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity
              of the adaptive site. Current statistical methods were expressly
              designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft
              sweeps. This is particularly unfortunate for the study of
              adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, where all
              three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft
              selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective
              population size relevant for recent and strong adaptation is
              large enough to generate soft sweeps even when adaptation
              requires mutation at a specific single site at a locus. Here, we
              develop a statistical test based on a measure of haplotype
              homozygosity (H12) that is capable of detecting both hard and
              soft sweeps with similar power. We use H12 to identify multiple

              melanogaster strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel

              in all cases multiple haplotypes are present at high frequencies,
              consistent with signatures of soft sweeps. We further develop a

              combination with H12, is capable of differentiating hard from
              soft sweeps. Surprisingly, we find that the H12 and H2/H1 values
              for all top 50 peaks are much more easily generated by soft
              rather than hard sweeps. We discuss the implications of these

  abstract = "Natural selection can produce a correlation between local
              recombination rates and levels of neutral DNA polymorphism as a
              consequence of genetic hitchhiking and background selection.
              Theory suggests that selection at linked sites should affect
              patterns of neutral variation in partially selfing populations
              more dramatically than in outcrossing populations. However,
              empirical investigations of selection at linked sites have
              focused primarily on outcrossing species. To assess the potential
              role of selection as a determinant of neutral polymorphism in the
              context of partial self-fertilization, we conducted a
              multivariate analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
              density throughout the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. We based the analysis on a published SNP data set and
              partitioned the genome into windows to calculate SNP densities,
              recombination rates, and gene densities across all six
              chromosomes. Our analyses identify a strong, positive correlation
              between recombination rate and neutral polymorphism (as estimated
              by noncoding SNP density) across the genome of C. elegans.
              Furthermore, we find that levels of neutral polymorphism are
              lower in gene-dense regions than in gene-poor regions in some
              analyses. Analyses incorporating local estimates of divergence
              between C. elegans and C. briggsae indicate that a mutational
              explanation alone is unlikely to explain the observed patterns.
              Consequently, we interpret these findings as evidence that
              natural selection shapes genome-wide patterns of neutral
              polymorphism in C. elegans. Our study provides the first
              demonstration of such an effect in a partially selfing animal.
              Explicit models of genetic hitchhiking and background selection
              can each adequately describe the relationship between
              recombination rate and SNP density, but only when they
              incorporate selfing rate. Clarification of the relative roles of
              genetic hitchhiking and background selection in C. elegans awaits
              the development of specific theoretical predictions that account

              allele frequency due to artificial or natural selection. This
              older technique has been popularized by the falling costs of high
              throughput sequencing. Initial HH-resequensing experiments seem
              to have found many thousands of polymorphisms responding to
              selection. We argue that this interpretation appears too
              optimistic, and that the data might in fact be more consistent
              with dozens, rather than thousands, of loci under selection. We
              propose several developments required for sensible data analyses
              that will fully realize the great power of the HH technique, and
              outline ways of moving forward.",

  abstract = "Populations can adapt over short, ecological timescales via
              standing genetic variation. Genomic data collected over tens of
              generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly
              used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation.
              Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such
              data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a
              polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus
              leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to
              heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become
              stochastically associated with. These associations perturb
              neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance
              across generations that can be directly measured from temporal
              genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of
              these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive
              genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population
              size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal
              genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role
              linked selection has on genome-wide diversity over short

              difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs)
              across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory
              natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and
              polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila
              simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a
              polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic
              redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent
              responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate,
              and fat content-and a strong polygenic response (99 selected

              been studied in the laboratory, but relatively little is known of
              fitness variation in natural environments or its causes. Lifetime
              fitness (recruitment) may be determined solely by producing many
              offspring, modified by stochastic effects on their subsequent
              survival up to the point of breeding, or by an additional
              contribution made by the high quality of the offspring owing to
              nonrandom mate choice. To investigate the determinants of
              lifetime fitness, we measured offspring production, longevity,
              and lifetime number of mates in four cohorts of two long-lived
              species of socially monogamous Darwin's finch species, Geospiza
              fortis and G. scandens, on the equatorial Gal{\'a}pagos Island of
              Daphne Major. Regression analysis showed that the lifetime
              production of fledglings was predicted by lifetime number of
              clutches and that recruitment was predicted by lifetime number of
              fledglings and longevity. There was little support for a
              hypothesis of selective mating by females. The offspring sired by
              extrapair mates were no more fit in terms of recruitment than
              were half-sibs sired by social mates. These findings provide
              insight into the evolution of life history strategies of tropical
              birds. Darwin's finches deviate from the standard tropical
              pattern of a slow pace of life by combining tropical (long
              lifespan) and temperate (large clutch size) characteristics. Our
              study of fitness shows why this is so in terms of selective
              pressures (fledgling production and adult longevity) and

              that beneficial substitutions to the genome may be common. All
              suffer from confounding factors, however, such that the
              interpretation of the evidence-in particular, conclusions about
              the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains
              tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D.
              simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to
              construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects
              of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity
              around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent
              selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around
              amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive
              pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This
              characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied
              on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter
              plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a
              straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences
              about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we
              develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire
              curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum
              likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid
              substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals
              two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately
              3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and
              accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the
              remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective
              effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent
              conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of
              selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal
              evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and
              illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be

               mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case,
               descendants of several of these independent origins may

  abstract = "The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics
              of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become
              a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to
              the classical ``hard sweep'' hitchhiking model, recent research
              has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation
              can play out in a variety of different ways and that the specific
              signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend
              somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for
              which a large number of empirical examples are already known is
              that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some
              low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to
              become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an
              analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended
              via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an
              analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing
              variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele
              and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of
              haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of
              the environmental change can be approximated by considering
              recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite-alleles model.
              We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate
              predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following
              such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources
              of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in
              distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other
              sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep and
              multiple-mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general,
              adaptation from a unique standing variant will likely be
              difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data
              from a single population time point alone, and when it can be
              detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other
              varieties of selective sweeps. Samples from multiple populations
              and/or time points have the potential to ease this difficulty.",

  title     = "Genetic hitchhiking",
  author    = "Barton, N H",
  abstract  = "Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes,
               even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This
               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r
               is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
               structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are
               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular
               evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be
               sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of
               neutral alleles.",

               genetics is the profound effect that natural selection on one
               locus can have on genetic variation patterns at linked loci.
               Since the first evidence for linked selection was uncovered in
               Drosophila melanogaster over two decades ago, substantial effort
               has focused on quantifying the effects and on distinguishing the
               relative contributions of purifying and positive selection. We
               introduce an approach to jointly model the effects of positive
               and negative selection along the genome and infer selection
               parameters. To this end, we consider how closely linked each
               neutral site is to different types of annotations and
               substitutions. When we apply the inference method to genome-wide
               data from 125 D. melanogaster lines, our model explains most of
               the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale and
               allows us to distinguish among the contribution of different
               modes of selection on proteins and UTRs. More generally, we
               provide a map of the effects of natural selection along the
               genome, and show that selection at linked sites has had an even
               more drastic effect on diversity patterns than previously
               appreciated. We also make a tool available to apply this

               of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and
               alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta).

               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system

               (Ne) from the standardized variance in allele frequency change
               (F) is presented in a generalized form. Whereas previous
               treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting
               assumptions, the present analysis shows that the temporal method
               is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a
               revised model of gene sampling permits a more generalized
               interpretation of Ne than that used by some other authors
               studying this method. It is shown that two sampling plans
               (individuals for genetic analysis taken before or after
               reproduction) whose differences have been stressed by previous
               authors can be treated in a uniform way. Computer simulations
               using a wide variety of initial conditions show that different
               formulas for computing F have much less effect on Ne than do
               sample size (S), number of generations between samples (t), or
               the number of loci studied (L). Simulation results also indicate
               that (1) bias of F is small unless alleles with very low
               frequency are used; (2) precision is typically increased by
               about the same amount with a doubling of S, t, or L; (3)
               confidence intervals for Ne computed using a chi 2 approximation
               are accurate and unbiased under most conditions; (4) the
               temporal method is best suited for use with organisms having
               high juvenile mortality and, perhaps, a limited effective
               population size.",

               has not yet been resolved: it is not clear to what extent the
               spread of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps) or the
               response of many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to
               environmental changes. Although much attention has been given to
               the genomic footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of
               selection on quantitative traits is still not well studied, as
               the associated genomic signature is extremely difficult to
               detect. We propose 'Evolve and Resequence' as a promising tool,
               to study polygenic adaptation of quantitative traits in evolving
               populations. Simulating replicated time series data we show that
               adaptation to a new intermediate trait optimum has three
               characteristic phases that are reflected on the genomic level:
               (1) directional frequency changes towards the new trait optimum,
               (2) plateauing of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum
               has been reached and (3) subsequent divergence between
               replicated trajectories ultimately leading to the loss or
               fixation of alleles while the trait value does not change. We
               explore these 3 phase characteristics for relevant population
               genetic parameters to provide expectations for various
               experimental evolution designs. Remarkably, over a broad range
               of parameters the trajectories of selected alleles display a
               pattern across replicates, which differs both from neutrality
               and directional selection. We conclude that replicated time
               series data from experimental evolution studies provide a
               promising framework to study polygenic adaptation from
               whole-genome population genetics data.",

  title     = "Patterns of neutral diversity under general models of selective
               sweeps",
  author    = "Coop, Graham and Ralph, Peter",
  abstract  = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high
               rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
               neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe
               goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to
               describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently
               available.",

               microsatellite map are now available, and haplotype data can be
               easily generated. We examined microsatellite variation around
               the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene on chromosome 4 of P.
               falciparum. Point mutations in dhfr are known to be responsible
               for resistance to the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine, and
               resistance to this drug has spread rapidly in Southeast (SE)
               Asia after its introduction in 1970s. We genotyped 33
               microsatellite markers distributed across chromosome 4 in 61
               parasites from a location on the Thailand/Myanmar border. We
               observed minimal microsatellite length variation in a 12-kb
               (0.7-cM) region flanking the dhfr gene and diminished variation
               for approximately 100 kb (6 cM), indicative of a single origin
               of resistant alleles. Furthermore, we found the same or similar
               microsatellite haplotypes flanked resistant dhfr alleles sampled
               from 11 parasite populations in five SE Asian countries
               indicating recent invasion of a single lineage of resistant dhfr
               alleles in locations 2000 km apart. Three features of these data
               are of especially interest. (1). Pyrimethamine resistance is
               generally assumed to have evolved multiple times because the
               genetic basis is simple and resistance can be selected easily in
               the laboratory. Yet our data clearly indicate a single origin of
               resistant dhfr alleles sampled over a large region of SE Asia.
               (2). The wide valley ( approximately 6 cM) of reduced variation
               around dhfr provides ``proof-of-principle'' that genome-wide
               association may be an effective way to locate genes under strong
               recent selection. (3). The width of the selective valley is
               consistent with predictions based on independent measures of
               recombination, mutation, and selection intensity, suggesting
               that we have reasonable estimates of these parameters. We
               conclude that scanning the malaria parasite genome for evidence
               of recent selection may prove an extremely effective way to
               locate genes underlying recently evolved traits such as drug
               resistance, as well as providing an opportunity to study the
               dynamics of selective events that have occurred recently or are
