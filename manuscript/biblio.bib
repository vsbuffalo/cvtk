  title    = "Hitchhiking effects of recurrent beneficial amino acid
              substitutions in the Drosophila melanogaster genome",
  author   = "Andolfatto, Peter",
  abstract = "Several recent studies have estimated that a large fraction of
              amino acid divergence between species of Drosophila was fixed by
              positive selection, using statistical approaches based on the
              McDonald-Kreitman test. However, little is known about associated
              selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations.
              Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions
              should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability
              data that contains information about the frequency and strength
              of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation
              between the level and the frequency of synonymous site
              polymorphism and the rate of protein evolution in highly
              recombining regions of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. This
              pattern is predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution and
              suggests that adaptation is an important determinant of patterns
              of neutral variation genome-wide. Using a maximum likelihood
              approach, I estimate the product of the rate and strength of
              selection under a recurrent genetic hitchhiking model,
              lambda2N(e)s approximately 3 x 10(-8). Using an approach based on
              the McDonald-Kreitman test, I estimate that approximately 50\% of
              divergent amino acids were driven to fixation by positive
              selection, implying that beneficial amino acid substitutions are
              of weak effect on average, on the order of 10(-5) (i.e., 2N(e)s
              approximately 40). Two implications of these results are that
              most adaptive substitutions will be difficult to detect in genome
              scans of selection and that population size (and genetic drift)
              may be an important determinant of the evolutionary dynamics of
              protein adaptation.",

              heterogeneous reduction in neutral polymorphism throughout the
              genome. The pattern of reduction depends on the selective
              advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many
              adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also
              contribute to nonsynonymous divergence, the spatial distribution
              of nonsynonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of
              adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between
              neutral polymorphism and nonsynonymous divergence may be
              especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we
              study this correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from
              Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D.
              melanogaster. Focusing on highly recombining portions of the
              autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of
              selective sweeps, we find that neutral polymorphism is both lower
              and, as measured by a new statistic Q(S), less homogeneous where
              nonsynonymous divergence is higher and that the spatial structure
              of this correlation is best explained by the action of strong
              recurrent selective sweeps. We introduce a method to infer, from
              the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence,
              the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results
              independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution
              (approximately 1/3000 generations) and newly suggest that many
              adaptations are of surprisingly great selective effect
              (approximately 1\%), reducing the effective population size by

  abstract = "Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular
              evolution saw little connection between natural selection and
              genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained
              fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is
              sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns
              of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence
              from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be
              invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species
              reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying
              selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large
              fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are
              adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila,

              biology through patterns of genetic polymorphism. Many approaches
              to reconstruct evolutionary histories focus on a limited number
              of informative statistics describing distributions of allele
              frequencies or patterns of linkage disequilibrium. We show that
              many commonly used statistics are part of a broad family of
              two-locus moments whose expectation can be computed jointly and
              rapidly under a wide range of scenarios, including complex

              selection causes a reduction in neutral diversity and efficacy of
              selection at genetically linked sites (a process called
              Background Selection, BGS). Population genetic studies, however,
              often ignore BGS effects when investigating demographic events or
              the presence of other types of selection. To obtain a more
              realistic evolutionary expectation that incorporates the
              unavoidable consequences of deleterious mutations, we generated
              high-resolution landscapes of variation across the Drosophila
              melanogaster genome under a BGS scenario independent of
              polymorphism data. We find that BGS plays a significant role in
              shaping levels of variation across the entire genome, including
              long introns and intergenic regions distant from annotated genes.
              We also find that a very large percentage of the observed
              variation in diversity across autosomes can be explained by BGS
              alone, up to 70\% across individual chromosome arms at 100-kb
              scale, thus indicating that BGS predictions can be used as
              baseline to infer additional types of selection and demographic
              events. This approach allows detecting several outlier regions
              with signal of recent adaptive events and selective sweeps. The
              use of a BGS baseline, however, is particularly appropriate to
              investigate the presence of balancing selection and our study
              exposes numerous genomic regions with the predicted signature of
              higher polymorphism than expected when a BGS context is taken
              into account. Importantly, we show that these conclusions are
              robust to the mutation and selection parameters of the BGS model.
              Finally, analyses of protein evolution together with previous
              comparisons of genetic maps between Drosophila species, suggest
              temporally variable recombination landscapes and, thus, local BGS
              effects that may differ between extant and past phases. Because
              genome-wide BGS and temporal changes in linkage effects can skew
              approaches to estimate demographic and selective events, future
              analyses should incorporate BGS predictions and capture local
              recombination variation across genomes and along lineages.",

              between limb bone size and body mass. This relationship has a
              genetic basis which likely evolved via natural selection, but it
              is unclear how much the genetic correlation between these traits
              in turn impacts their capacity to evolve independently. We
              selectively bred laboratory mice for increases in tibia length
              independent of body mass, to test the hypothesis that a genetic
              correlation with body mass constrains evolutionary change in
              tibia length. RESULTS: Over 14 generations, we produced mean
              tibia length increases of 9-13\%, while mean body mass was
              unchanged, in selectively bred mice and random-bred controls.
              Using evolutionary scenarios with different selection and
              quantitative genetic parameters, we also found that this genetic
              correlation impedes the rate of evolutionary change in both
              traits, slowing increases in tibia length while preventing
              decreases in body mass, despite the latter's negative effect on
              fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results from this ongoing
              selection experiment suggest that parallel evolution of
              relatively longer hind limbs among rodents, for example in the
              context of strong competition for resources and niche

               to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent
               adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of
               positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it
               arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental
               changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or
               deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect
               this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked
               neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive
               directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a
               neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at
               frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation.
               Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large
               variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage
               disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for
               intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a
               loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the
               signature of directional selection currently relied on by

              genetic variation remains controversial. This is in part due to
              the limited evidence in humans for classic ``hard selective

              high population frequency, in a soft selective sweep multiple
              adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously,
              producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity
              of the adaptive site. Current statistical methods were expressly
              designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft
              sweeps. This is particularly unfortunate for the study of
              adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, where all
              three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft
              selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective

  abstract = "Natural selection can produce a correlation between local
              recombination rates and levels of neutral DNA polymorphism as a
              consequence of genetic hitchhiking and background selection.
              Theory suggests that selection at linked sites should affect
              patterns of neutral variation in partially selfing populations
              more dramatically than in outcrossing populations. However,
              empirical investigations of selection at linked sites have
              focused primarily on outcrossing species. To assess the potential
              role of selection as a determinant of neutral polymorphism in the
              context of partial self-fertilization, we conducted a
              multivariate analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
              density throughout the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. We based the analysis on a published SNP data set and
              partitioned the genome into windows to calculate SNP densities,
              recombination rates, and gene densities across all six
              chromosomes. Our analyses identify a strong, positive correlation
              between recombination rate and neutral polymorphism (as estimated
              by noncoding SNP density) across the genome of C. elegans.
              Furthermore, we find that levels of neutral polymorphism are
              lower in gene-dense regions than in gene-poor regions in some
              analyses. Analyses incorporating local estimates of divergence
              between C. elegans and C. briggsae indicate that a mutational
              explanation alone is unlikely to explain the observed patterns.
              Consequently, we interpret these findings as evidence that
              natural selection shapes genome-wide patterns of neutral
              polymorphism in C. elegans. Our study provides the first
              demonstration of such an effect in a partially selfing animal.
              Explicit models of genetic hitchhiking and background selection
              can each adequately describe the relationship between
              recombination rate and SNP density, but only when they
              incorporate selfing rate. Clarification of the relative roles of
              genetic hitchhiking and background selection in C. elegans awaits
              the development of specific theoretical predictions that account

              generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly
              used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation.
              Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such
              data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a
              polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus
              leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to
              heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become
              stochastically associated with. These associations perturb
              neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance
              across generations that can be directly measured from temporal
              genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of
              these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in

              genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population

              or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a
              genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed
              within families as a normal random variable centred at the
              average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance
              independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that
              segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can
              be predicted from the variance components. This does not
              necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole
              population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population
              structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait
              distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general
              conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to
              be accurate. We first review the long history of the
              infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate
              the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait
              values and relationships between individuals, but including
              different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination,
              selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of
              examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to

              noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely
              additive. We also show how the model generalises to include
              epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each
              family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in
              the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a
              variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order

              contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing
              to standing variation are of small effect, how does local
              adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and
              quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations
              to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on
              the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing
              genetic variation (V(G)), and the susceptibility of alleles to
              swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping
              for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve
              at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient V(G). However, in
              such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is
              transient: F(ST) is low across all loci, and no locus makes an
              important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local
              adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and
              allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficult--if
              not impossible--to detect using current approaches to studying
              the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and
              resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if
              genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results
              suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the

              To test the hypothesis that these freshwater populations were

              Obviously, mutation-selection balance must play a role, but there
              is considerable doubt over whether it can account for
              heritabilities as high as 0.5, which are commonly found in
              natural populations. Most models of mutation-selection balance
              assume panmictic populations. In this paper we use Monte Carlo
              simulations to examine the effect of isolation by distance on the
              variation maintained by mutation in a polygenic trait subject to
              optimizing selection. We show that isolation by distance can
              substantially increase the total variation maintained in
              continuous populations over a wide range of dispersal patterns,
              but only if more than one genotype produces the optimal phenotype
              (genetic redundancy). Isolation by distance alone has only a
              slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population
              for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance
              and genetic redundancy, however, allows the maintenance of
              substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. The
              mechanism is straightforward. Isolation by distance allows
              mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of
              the population. Because of their independent evolutionary
              histories, different parts of the population independently draw
              from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the
              genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among
              them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The
              population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. We show
              that this process allows mutation to maintain high levels of
              variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and that over
              a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation
              maintained in the entire population is independent of both the
              strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance.
              Furthermore, we show that individual heterozygosity is increased
              in locally mating populations when selection is strong. Finally,
              our simulations provide a rough picture of how selection and the

              first high resolution recombination map for D. simulans, and
              searched for motifs linked with high recombination in both sister
              species. We identified five consensus motifs, present in either
              species. While the association between motif density and
              recombination is strong and positive in D. melanogaster, the
              results are equivocal in D. simulans. Despite the strong
              association in D. melanogaster, we do not find a decreasing
              density of these repeat motifs towards centromeres and telomeres.
              We conclude that the density of recombination-associated repeat
              motifs cannot explain the large-scale recombination landscape in
              D. melanogaster, nor the differences to D. simulans. The strong
              association seen for the sequence motifs in D. melanogaster
              likely reflects their impact influencing local differences in
              recombination rates along the genome.",

              genetic loci-but most molecularly characterized traits have a
              simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the
              difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs)
              across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory
              natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and
              polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila
              simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a
              polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic
              redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent
              responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate,
              and fat content-and a strong polygenic response (99 selected
              alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles
              increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving

              largely determined by its demographic history, typically
              summarized by its long-term effective population size (Ne).
              Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this
              relationship, however. To better understand how changing
              demography impacts selection, we used whole-genome sequencing

  abstract = "Abstract Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of
              ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they
              have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological
              interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type
              go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary
              dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors
              have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by
              comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary
              rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid
              evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological
              processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined
              as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable
              impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition
              we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change
              into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by
              change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent
              population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is
              judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution
              to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of
              other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based
              on a theoretical predator?prey interaction [Abrams, P. \&
              Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this
              system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth
              rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then
              propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in
              field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for
              which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both
              data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been
              found when measured as character change in standard deviations
              per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in
              response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R.
              (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change
              has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2.
              For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history
              evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G.
              Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that
              evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of
              ecological change ? less than in the finch example, but
              nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in
              order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it
              is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the
              system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a

              fitness (recruitment) may be determined solely by producing many

              survival up to the point of breeding, or by an additional
              contribution made by the high quality of the offspring owing to
              nonrandom mate choice. To investigate the determinants of
              lifetime fitness, we measured offspring production, longevity,

              the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains
              tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D.
              simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to
              construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects
              of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity
              around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent
              selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around
              amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive
              pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This
              characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied
              on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter
              plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a
              straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences
              about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we
              develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire
              curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum
              likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13\% of amino acid
              substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals
              two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately
              3\%) that appears to have had large selective effects and
              accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the
              remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very weak selective

               mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case,
               descendants of several of these independent origins may

  abstract = "The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics
              of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become
              a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to
              the classical ``hard sweep'' hitchhiking model, recent research
              has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation
              can play out in a variety of different ways and that the specific
              signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend
              somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for
              which a large number of empirical examples are already known is
              that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some
              low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to
              become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an
              analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended
              via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an
              analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing
              variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele
              and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of
              haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of
              the environmental change can be approximated by considering
              recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite-alleles model.
              We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate
              predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following
              such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources
              of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in
              distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other
              sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep and
              multiple-mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general,
              adaptation from a unique standing variant will likely be
              difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data
              from a single population time point alone, and when it can be
              detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other
              varieties of selective sweeps. Samples from multiple populations
              and/or time points have the potential to ease this difficulty.",

              dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes.
              Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve
              experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome

              signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the
              experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously
              competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between

              long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most

  author   = "Turelli, Michael",
  abstract = "Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable ``factors''
              contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation could result.
              Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between Mendelian
              inheritance and continuous trait variation by assuming many loci,
              each with small effect, and by informally invoking the central
              limit theorem. Barton et al. (2017) rigorously analyze the
              approach to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the genetic
              effects for descendants of parents who may be related. This
              commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to
              as ``infinitesimal genetics,'' ``Gaussian descendants'' and
              ``Gaussian population,'' each plausibly called ``the
              infinitesimal model.'' The first and most basic is Fisher's
              ``infinitesimal'' approximation of the underlying genetics -
              namely, many loci, each making a small contribution to the total
              variance. As Barton et al. (2017) show, in the limit as the
              number of loci increases (with enough additivity), the
              distribution of genotypic values for descendants approaches a
              multivariate Gaussian, whose variance-covariance structure
              depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the
              parents (or whether their population experiences selection or
              other processes such as mutation and migration). Barton et al.
              (2017) call this rigorously defensible ``Gaussian descendants''
              approximation ``the infinitesimal model.'' However, it is widely
              assumed that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian
              approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in a
              population follows a Gaussian - even if the population is subject
              to non-Gaussian selection. This third ``Gaussian population''
              approximation, is also described as the ``infinitesimal model.''
              Unlike the ``Gaussian descendants'' approximation, this third
              approximation cannot be rigorously justified, except in a
              weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model.
              Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions
              of selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic
              variances, the ``breeder's equation'' and the ``Bulmer effect.''
              Future generations may understand why the ``infinitesimal model''
              provides such useful approximations in the face of epistasis,
              linkage, linkage disequilibrium and strong selection.",

  abstract  = "Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes,
               even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This
               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r
               is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
               structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are
               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular
               evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be
               sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of

               genetics is the profound effect that natural selection on one
               locus can have on genetic variation patterns at linked loci.
               Since the first evidence for linked selection was uncovered in
               Drosophila melanogaster over two decades ago, substantial effort
               has focused on quantifying the effects and on distinguishing the
               relative contributions of purifying and positive selection. We
               introduce an approach to jointly model the effects of positive
               and negative selection along the genome and infer selection
               parameters. To this end, we consider how closely linked each
               neutral site is to different types of annotations and
               substitutions. When we apply the inference method to genome-wide
               data from 125 D. melanogaster lines, our model explains most of
               the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale and
               allows us to distinguish among the contribution of different
               modes of selection on proteins and UTRs. More generally, we
               provide a map of the effects of natural selection along the
               genome, and show that selection at linked sites has had an even
               more drastic effect on diversity patterns than previously
               appreciated. We also make a tool available to apply this

  abstract  = "Whole-genome resequencing of experimental populations evolving
               under a specific selection regime has become a popular approach
               to determine genotype-phenotype maps and understand adaptation
               to new environments. Despite its conceptual appeal and success
               in identifying some causative genes, it has become apparent that
               many studies suffer from an excess of candidate loci. Several
               explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon, but it is
               clear that information about the linkage structure during such
               experiments is needed. Until now only Pool-Seq (whole-genome
               sequencing of pools of individuals) data were available, which
               do not provide sufficient information about the correlation
               between linked sites. We address this problem in two
               complementary analyses of three replicate Drosophila
               melanogaster populations evolving to a new hot temperature
               environment for almost 70 generations. In the first analysis, we
               sequenced 58 haploid genomes from the founder population and
               evolved flies at generation 67. We show that during the
               experiment linkage disequilibrium (LD) increased almost
               uniformly over much greater distances than typically seen in
               Drosophila. In the second analysis, Pool-Seq time series data of
               the three replicates were combined with haplotype information
               from the founder population to follow blocks of initial
               haplotypes over time. We identified 17 selected haplotype-blocks
               that started at low frequencies in the base population and
               increased in frequency during the experiment. The size of these
               haplotype-blocks ranged from 0.082 to 4.01 Mb. Moreover, between
               42\% and 46\% of the top candidate single nucleotide
               polymorphisms from the comparison of founder and evolved
               populations fell into the genomic region covered by the
               haplotype-blocks. We conclude that LD in such rising
               haplotype-blocks results in long range hitchhiking over multiple
               kilobase-sized regions. LD in such haplotype-blocks is therefore
               a major factor contributing to an excess of candidate loci.
               Although modifications of the experimental design may help to
               reduce the hitchhiking effect and allow for more precise mapping
               of causative variants, we also note that such haplotype-blocks
               might be well suited to study the dynamics of selected genomic
               regions during experimental evolution studies.",

               advantages among families (the squared coefficient of variation
               of the expected number of offspring per family), alpha I is the
               deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, alpha O is the

               the term accounting for the cumulative effect of selection on an

               G is the remaining proportion of genetic variance in selected
               individuals and r is the correlation of the expected selective

               to the general case of different numbers of male and female
               parents. The predictive value of the formulae is tested under a
               model of truncation selection with the infinitesimal model of
               gene effects, where C2 and G are a function of the selection
               intensity, the heritability and the intraclass correlation of
               sibs. Under random mating r = alpha I = -1/(N - 1) and alpha O =
               0. Under partial full-sib mating with an average proportion beta
               of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and
               alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta).
               The prediction equation is compared to other approximations
               based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to
               descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system
               of mating (compensatory mating) is proposed to reduce rates of

               is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a

               spread of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps) or the
               response of many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to
               environmental changes. Although much attention has been given to
               the genomic footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of
               selection on quantitative traits is still not well studied, as
               the associated genomic signature is extremely difficult to
               detect. We propose 'Evolve and Resequence' as a promising tool,
               to study polygenic adaptation of quantitative traits in evolving
               populations. Simulating replicated time series data we show that
               adaptation to a new intermediate trait optimum has three
               characteristic phases that are reflected on the genomic level:
               (1) directional frequency changes towards the new trait optimum,
               (2) plateauing of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum
               has been reached and (3) subsequent divergence between
               replicated trajectories ultimately leading to the loss or
               fixation of alleles while the trait value does not change. We
               explore these 3 phase characteristics for relevant population
               genetic parameters to provide expectations for various
               experimental evolution designs. Remarkably, over a broad range
               of parameters the trajectories of selected alleles display a
               pattern across replicates, which differs both from neutrality
               and directional selection. We conclude that replicated time
               series data from experimental evolution studies provide a

               whole-genome population genetics data.",

  abstract  = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
               alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
               drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
               alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
               selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
               plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
               number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
               selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
               arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
               selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
               destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
               recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
               generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
               selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
               large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
               allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
               under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the
               subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory
               to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial
               sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given
               reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
               on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined
               primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected
               alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to
               low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of
               diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively
               unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high
               rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
               neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe
               goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to
               describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently
               available.",

               around dhfr provides ``proof-of-principle'' that genome-wide
               association may be an effective way to locate genes under strong
               recent selection. (3). The width of the selective valley is
               consistent with predictions based on independent measures of
               recombination, mutation, and selection intensity, suggesting
               that we have reasonable estimates of these parameters. We
               conclude that scanning the malaria parasite genome for evidence
               of recent selection may prove an extremely effective way to
               locate genes underlying recently evolved traits such as drug
               resistance, as well as providing an opportunity to study the
               dynamics of selective events that have occurred recently or are
               currently in progress.",
