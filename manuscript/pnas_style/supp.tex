\section{Estimator Bias Correction}
\subsection{Correcting variance bias with a single depth sampling process}
\label{supp:depth-var-corr}

Following \textcite{Waples1989-sj}, we have that the variance in allele
frequency change at a locus in the initial generation, which is entirely due to
a binomial sampling process, is $\var(p_0) = \nicefrac{p_0(1-p_0)}{d_0}$
where $d_0$ is the number of binomial draws (e.g. read depth). At a later
timepoint, the variance in allele frequency is a result of both the binomial
sampling process at time $t$ and the evolutionary process. Using the law of
total variation we can partition the variation from each process,

\begin{align}
  \var(\widetilde{p_t}) &= \E(\var(\widetilde{p_t} | p_t)) + \var(\E(\widetilde{p_t}|p_t)) \\
                        &= \underbrace{\frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{d_t}}_\text{generation $t$ sampling noise} + \underbrace{\var(p_t)}_\text{variance due to evolutionary process}.
  %\frac{\var(\widetilde{p_t})}{p_0(1-p_0)} &= \frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{p_0(1-p_0) d_t} + 1 - \left( 1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t.
  %\frac{\var(\widetilde{p_t})}{p_0(1-p_0)} &= \frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{p_0(1-p_0) d_t} + \frac{t}{2N} + O\left((2 N)^{-2}\right).
\end{align}

Under a drift-only process, $\var(p_t) = p_0(1-p_0)\left[1- \left(1 -
\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t\right]$. However, with heritable variation in fitness, we
need to consider the covariance in allele frequency changes across generations
\parencite{Buffalo2019-io}. We can write

\begin{align}
  \var(p_t) &= \var\left(p_0 + (p_1 - p_0) + (p_2 - p_1) + \ldots + (p_t - p_{t-1}) \right) \\
         &= \var\left(p_0 + \Delta p_0 + \Delta p_1 + \ldots + \Delta p_{t-1} \right) \\
         &= \var(p_0) + \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \cov(p_0, \Delta p_i) + \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta p_i) + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j).
\end{align}
%

Each allele frequency change is equally like to be positive as it is to be
negative; thus by symmetry this second term is zero. Additionally $\var(p_0) = 0$,
as we treat $p_0$ as a fixed initial frequency. We can write, 

\begin{align}
  \var(p_t) &= \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta p_i) + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j).
\end{align}
%
The second term, the cumulative impact of variance in allele frequency change
can be partitioned into heritable fitness and drift components
\parencite{Santiago1995-hx,Buffalo2019-io}

\begin{align}
  \var(p_t) &= \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_D} p_i) + \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_H} p_i) + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j).
\end{align}
%
where $\Delta_{_H} p_t$ and $\Delta_{_D} p_t$ indicate the allele frequency
change due to heritable fitness variation and drift respectively. Then, sum of
drift variances in allele frequency change is

\begin{align}
  \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_D} p_i) = \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{p_i(1-p_i)}{2N}
\end{align}
%
replacing the heterozygosity in generation $i$ with its expectation, we have

\begin{align}
  \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_D} p_i) &= p_0(1-p_0) \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{1}{2N} \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^i \\
                                         &= p_0(1-p_0) \left[1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t \right]
\end{align}
%
which is the usual variance in allele frequency change due to drift.  Then, the
total allele frequency change from generations $0$ to $t$ is
$\var(\widetilde{p}_t - \widetilde{p}_0) = \var(\widetilde{p}_t) +
\var(\widetilde{p}_0) - 2 \cov(\widetilde{p}_t, \widetilde{p}_0)$, where the
covariance depends on the nature of the sampling plan (see \cite{Nei1981-oy,
Waples1989-sj}). In the case where there is heritable variation for fitness,
and using the fact that $\cov(\widetilde{p}_t, \widetilde{p}_0) =
\nicefrac{p_0(1-p_0)}{2N}$ for Plan I sampling procedures
\parencite{Waples1989-sj}, we write,

\begin{align}
  \var(\widetilde{p}_t - \widetilde{p}_0) &= \var(\widetilde{p}_t) + \var(\widetilde{p}_0) - 2 C \cov(\widetilde{p}_t, \widetilde{p}_0) \\
                                          &= \frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{d_t}  + \frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{d_0} + p_0(1-p_0) \left[1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t \right] + \\ & \;\;\;\;\;\;
                                               \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_H} p_i)  + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j) - \frac{C p_0(1-p_0)}{2N} \\
  \frac{\var(\widetilde{p}_t - \widetilde{p}_0)}{p_0(1-p_0)} &= 1 + \frac{p_t(1-p_t)}{p_0(1-p_0)d_t}  + \frac{1}{d_0} - \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t + \\ & \;\;\;\;\;\;
  \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{\var(\Delta_{_H} p_i)}{p_0(1-p_0)}  + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \frac{\cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j)}{p_0(1-p_0)} - \frac{C}{N}
\end{align}
%
where $C = 1$ if Plan I is used, and $C=0$ if Plan II is used (see
\cite{Waples1989-sj}, p. 380 and Figure 1 for a description of these sampling
procedures; throughout the paper we use sampling Plan II). Rearranging, we can
create a bias-corrected estimator for the population variance in allele
frequency change, and replace all population heterozygosity terms with the
unbiased sample estimators, e.g. $\frac{d_t}{d_t-1} \widetilde{p}_t (1-
\widetilde{p}_t)$,

\begin{align}
  \label{supp:eqn-depth-only-correction}
  \frac{d_0-1}{d_0} \frac{\var(\widetilde{p}_1 - \widetilde{p}_0)}{\widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)} - \frac{(d_0-1)}{d_0 (d_1 - 1)} \frac{\widetilde{p}_1(1-\widetilde{p}_1)}{\widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)} - \frac{1}{d_0} + \frac{C}{N}  &= \frac{\var(\Delta_{_H} p_0)}{p_0(1-p_0)} + \frac{1}{2N} 
\end{align}

\subsection{Correcting variance bias with individual and depth sampling processes}
\label{supp:ind-depth-var-corr}

Here, we extend the sampling bias correction described above to handle two
binomial sampling processes: one as individuals are binomially sampled from the
population, and another as reads are binomially sampled during sequencing.
(see also \cite{Jonas2016-ia}). Let $X_t \sim \text{Binom}(n_t, p_t)$ where
$X_t$ is the count of alleles and $n_t$ is the number of diploids sampled at
time $t$. Then, these individuals are sequenced at a depth of $d_t$, and $Y_t
\sim \text{Binom}(d_t, \nicefrac{X_t}{n_t})$ reads have the tracked allele. We
let $\widetilde{p_t} = \nicefrac{Y_t}{d_t}$ be the observed sample allele
frequency. Then, the sampling noise is 

\begin{align}
  \var(\widetilde{p_t}|p_t) &= \E(\var(\widetilde{p_t} | X_t)) + \var(\E(\widetilde{p_t} | X_t)) \\
                            &= p_t(1-p_t) \left(\frac{1}{n_t} + \frac{1}{d_t} - \frac{1}{n_t d_t} \right)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
  \var(\widetilde{p}_t - \widetilde{p}_0) &= 
  p_t(1-p_t) \left(\frac{1}{n_t} + \frac{1}{d_t} - \frac{1}{n_t d_t} \right)  
  + p_0(1-p_0) \left( \frac{1}{n_0} + \frac{1}{d_0} - \frac{1}{n_0 d_0}\right)  \\ & \;\;\;\;\;\;
  - \frac{C p_0(1-p_0)}{N} + p_0(1-p_0) \left[1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t \right]+ \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_H} p_i)  \\ & \;\;\;\;\;\; + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j) 
\end{align}
%
Through the law of total expectation (see \cite{Kolaczkowski2011-ee}
Supplementary File 1 for a sample proof), one can find that an unbiased
estimator of the half the heterozygosity is 

\begin{align}
  \frac{n_t d_t}{(n_t-1) (d_t-1)} \widetilde{p_t}(1-\widetilde{p_t}).
\end{align}
%
Replacing this unbiased estimator for half of the heterozygosity into our
expression above, the total sample variance is

\begin{align}
  \var(\widetilde{p}_t - \widetilde{p}_0) &= 
  \frac{n_t d_t \widetilde{p}_t(1-\widetilde{p}_t)}{(n_t-1)(d_t-1)} \left(\frac{1}{n_t} + \frac{1}{d_t} - \frac{1}{n_t d_t} \right) + 
 \frac{n_0 d_0 \widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)}{(n_0-1)(d_0-1)} \left( \frac{1}{n_0} + \frac{1}{d_0} - \frac{1}{n_0 d_0}\right) + \\ & \nonumber\;\;\;\;\;\;
 \frac{n_0 d_0 \widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)}{(n_0-1)(d_0-1)}   \left[1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t \right]  - \frac{C}{N}  \frac{n_0 d_0 \widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)}{(n_0-1)(d_0-1)} + \\ \nonumber & \;\;\;\;\;\; \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_H} p_i)  + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j).  \\
                                                                                                                      % &= \widetilde{p}_t(1-\widetilde{p}_t)\frac{d_t + n_t - 1}{(n_t-1)(d_t-1)} + 
 % \widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)\frac{d_0 + n_0 - 1}{(n_0-1)(d_0-1)} + \\ & \nonumber\;\;\;\;\;\;
 % \widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0) \frac{n_0 d_0}{(n_0-1)(d_0-1)}  \left[1 - \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^t \right] - \frac{C}{N} \widetilde{p}_0(1-\widetilde{p}_0)\frac{n_0 d_0}{(n_0-1)(d_0-1)} 
 % \\ \nonumber & \;\;\;\;\;\; + \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{_H} p_i)  + \sum_{0 \le i < j}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j). 
\end{align}
%
As with equation \eqref{supp:eqn-depth-only-correction}, we can rearrange this
to get a biased-corrected estimate of the variance in allele frequency change
between adjacent generations, $\var(\Delta p_t)$. 


\subsection{Covariance Correction}
\label{supp:cov-corr}

We also need to apply a bias correction to the temporal covariances (and
possibly the replicate covariances if the initial sample frequencies are all
shared). The basic issue is that $\cov(\Delta \widetilde{p}_t, \Delta
\widetilde{p}_{t+1}) = \cov(\widetilde{p}_{t+1} - \widetilde{p}_t,
\widetilde{p}_{t+2} - \widetilde{p}_{t+1})$, and thus shares the sampling noise
of timepoint $t+1$. Thus acts to bias the covariance by subtracting off the
noise variance term of $\var(\widetilde{p}_{t+1})$, so we add the expectation
of this bias, derived above, back in. We discuss this in more detail below in
deriving the bias correction for the temporal-replicate variance covariance
matrix.

\subsection{Temporal-Replicate Covariance Matrix Correction}
\label{supp:matrix-correction}

In practice, we simultaneously estimate the temporal and replicate covariance
matrices for each replicate, which we call the temporal-replicate covariance
matrix. This needs a bias correction; we extend the bias corrections for single
locus variance and covariance described in Supplementary Material Sections
\ref{supp:depth-var-corr}, \ref{supp:ind-depth-var-corr}, and
\ref{supp:cov-corr} to multiple sampled loci and the temporal-replicate
covariance matrix here. With frequency data collected at $T+1$ timepoints
across $R$ replicate populations at $L$ loci, we have multidimensional arrays
$\mathbf{F}$ of allele frequencies, $\mathbf{D}$ of sequencing depths, and
$\mathbf{N}$ of the number of individuals sequenced, each of dimension $R
\times (T+1) \times L$.  We calculate the array $\mathbf{\Delta F}$ which
contains the allele frequency changes between adjacent generations, and has
dimension $R \times T \times L$.  The operation
$\flt(\mathbf{\Delta}\mathbf{F})$ flattens this array to a $(R \cdot T) \times
L$ matrix, such that rows are grouped by replicate, e.g. for timepoint $t$,
replicate $r$, and locus $l$ such that for allele frequencies $p_{t, r, l}$,
the frequency change entries are 

\begin{align}
    \flt(\mathbf{\Delta F}) &=
                    &\begin{bmatrix} 
    \Delta p_{1, 0, 0} & \Delta p_{2, 0, 0} & \ldots & \Delta p_{1, 1, 0} & \Delta p_{2, 1, 0} & \ldots & \Delta p_{T, R, 0}  \\
    \Delta p_{1, 0, 1} & \Delta p_{2, 0, 1} & \ldots & \Delta p_{1, 1, 1} & \Delta p_{2, 1, 1} & \ldots & \Delta p_{T, R, 1}  \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots  \\
    \Delta p_{1, 0, L} & \Delta p_{2, 0, L} & \ldots & \Delta p_{1, 1, L} & \Delta p_{2, 1, L} & \ldots & \Delta p_{T, R, L}  \\
  \end{bmatrix} 
\end{align}
%
where each $\Delta p_{t, r, l} = p_{t+1, r, l} - p_{t, r, l}$. Then, the sample
temporal-replicate covariance matrix $\mathbf{Q}'$ calculated on
$\flt(\mathbf{\Delta F})$ is a $(R \cdot T) \times (R \cdot T)$ matrix, with
the $R$ temporal-covariance block submatrices along the diagonal, and the
$R(R-1)$ replicate-covariance submatrices matrices in the upper and lower
triangles of the matrix,

\begin{align}
	\mathbf{Q}' &= 
  \begin{bmatrix} 
		\mathbf{Q}_{1,1}' & \mathbf{Q}_{1, 2}' & \ldots & \mathbf{Q}_{1, R}' \\ 
		\mathbf{Q}_{2,1}' & \mathbf{Q}_{2, 2}' & \ldots & \mathbf{Q}_{2, R}' \\ 
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		\mathbf{Q}_{R,1}' & \mathbf{Q}_{R, 2}' & \ldots & \mathbf{Q}_{R, R}' \\ 
  \end{bmatrix} 
\end{align}
%
where each submatrix $\mathbf{Q}_{i,j}'$ ($i \ne j$) is the $T \times T$ sample
replicate covariance matrix for replicates $i$ and $j$, and the submatrices
along the diagonal $\mathbf{Q}_{r,r}'$ are the temporal covariance matrices for
replicate $r$.

Given the bias of the sample covariance of allele frequency changes, we
calculated an expected bias matrix $\mathbf{B}$, averaging over loci,

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^L \frac{\mathbf{h}_l}{2} \circ \left( \frac{1}{\mathbf{d}_l} + \frac{1}{2\mathbf{n}_l} + \frac{1}{2\mathbf{d}_l \circ \mathbf{n}_l} \right)
\end{align}
%
where $\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and $\mathbf{h}_l$, $\mathbf{d}_l$,
and $\mathbf{n}_l$, are rows corresponding to locus $l$ of the unbiased
heterozygosity arrays $\mathbf{H}$, depth matrix $\mathbf{D}$, and number of
diploids matrix $\mathbf{N}$. The unbiased $R \times (T+1) \times L$
heterozygosity array can be calculated as  

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{H} = \frac{2 \mathbf{D} \circ \mathbf{N} }{ (\mathbf{D}-1) \circ (\mathbf{N} -1)} \circ \mathbf{F} \circ (1-\mathbf{F})
\end{align}
%
where division here is elementwise. Thus, $\mathbf{B}$ is a $R \times (T+1)$
matrix. As explained in Supplementary Material Section
\ref{supp:ind-depth-var-corr} and \ref{supp:cov-corr}, the temporal variances
and covariances require bias corrections, meaning each temporal covariance
submatrix $\mathbf{Q}_{r,r}$ requires two corrections. For an element
$Q_{r,t,s} = \cov(\Delta p_t, \Delta p_s)$ of the temporal covariance submatrix
for replicate $r$, $\mathbf{Q}_{r,r}$, we apply the following correction

\begin{equation}
	Q_{r,t,s} =  
		\begin{dcases}
			Q_{r,t,s}' - b_{r,t} - b_{r,t+1}, & \text{if  } t = s \\
      Q_{r,t,s}' + b_{r,\max(t,s)}, & \text{if  } |t - s| = 1 \\
		\end{dcases}
\end{equation}
%
where $b_{r,t}$ is element in row $r$ and column $t$ of $\mathbf{B}$.

\section{\textcite{Barghi2019-qy} Temporal Covariances}
\label{supp:barghi-covs}

Since each replicate population was sequenced every ten generations, the
timepoints $t_0 = 0$ generations, $t_1 = 10$ generations, $t_2 = 20$
generations, etc., lead to observed allele frequency changes across ten
generation blocks, $\Delta p_{t_0}, \Delta p_{t_1}, \ldots, \Delta p_{t_6}$.
Consequently, the ten temporal covariance matrices for each of the ten
replicate populations have off-diagonal elements of the form $\cov(\Delta
p_{t_0}, \Delta p_{t_1}) = \cov(p_{t_1} - p_{t_0}, p_{t_2} - p_{t_1}) =
\sum_{i=0}^{10} \sum_{j=10}^{20} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j)$. Each
diagonal element has the form $\var(\Delta p_{t_0}) = \sum_{i=0}^{t_0-1}
\var(\Delta p_{i}) + \sum_{i = 0}^{t_0 - 1} \sum_{j \ne i}^{t_0-1} \cov(\Delta
p_{i}, \Delta p_{j})$, and is thus a combination of the effects of drift and
selection, as both the variance in allele frequency changes and cumulative
temporal autocovariances terms increase the variance in allele frequency. With
sampling each generation, one could more accurately partition the total
variance in allele frequency change \parencite{Buffalo2019-io}; while we cannot
directly estimate the contribution of linked selection to the variance in
allele frequency change here, the presence of a positive observed covariance
between allele frequency change can only be caused linked selection. 

\section{Block Bootstrap Procedure}
\label{supp:block-bootstrap}

% TODO: put equations in?

The estimators used in this paper are predominantly ratios, e.g.
temporal-replicate covariance standardized by half the heterozygosity, $G(t)$
which is the ratio of cumulative covariance to total variance, and the
convergence correlation (equation \eqref{eq:conv-corr}). In these cases, we can
exploit the linearity of the expectation to make the bootstrap procedure more
computationally efficient, by pre-calculating the statistics of the ratio's
numerator and denominator, $N(\mathbf{x}_i)$ and $D(\mathbf{x}_i)$, on the data
$\mathbf{x}_i$ for all blocks $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, W\}$ in the genome. Then
we draw $W$ bootstrap samples with replacement, and compute the estimate for
bootstrap sample $b$ with an average weighted by the fraction $w_i$ of total
loci contained in each block, 

\begin{align}
  \tilde{\theta}_b = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^W w_i N(\mathbf{x}_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^W w_i D(\mathbf{x}_i)}
\end{align}
%
Note that computing the ratio of averages rather than the average of a ratio is
a practice common for population genetic statistics like $F_{ST}$
\parencite{Bhatia2013-zy}. With these $B$ bootstrap estimates, we calculate the
$\nicefrac{\alpha}{2}$ and $1-\nicefrac{\alpha}{2}$ quantiles, which we use to
estimate the $1-\alpha = 95\%$ pivot confidence intervals (p. 33
\cite{Wasserman2006-jl}, p. 194 \cite{Davison2013-oy}) throughout the paper,

\begin{align}
  C_\alpha = \left(2 \widehat{\theta} - q_{1-\nicefrac{\alpha}{2}}, 2 \widehat{\theta} - q_{\nicefrac{\alpha}{2}} \right).
\end{align}
%
where $\widehat{\theta}$ is the estimate, and $q_x$ is bootstrap quantile for
probability $x$.

\section{Replicate $G(t)$ and Partitioning the Variance in Allele Frequency}
\label{supp:replicate-g}

We define a statistic similar to $G(t)$ for estimating the proportion of allele
frequency change common between two replicate populations due to linked
selection. Covariance in allele frequency change between two replicate
populations is due to convergent selection pressure selecting haplotypes shared
between the two replicate populations, which acts to perturb linked neutral
variation in parallel way. 

\begin{align}
  G_R(t) = \frac{\E_{A \ne B}(\sum_{i\ne j}^t \cov(\Delta p_{i,A}, \Delta p_{j,B}))}{\E_R(\var(p_{t,R} - p_{0,R}))}
\end{align}
%
where $\E_{A \ne B}$ indicates that the expectation is taken over all ordered
pairs of replicates (e.g. summing all off-diagonal elements replicate
covariances), and $\E_R$ indicates taking expectation over all replicates. This
measures the fraction of variance in allele frequency change (averaged across
replicates) due to shared selection pressure.

Extending our theoretic work in \textcite{Buffalo2019-io}, we can partition the
allele frequency change in two replicates into drift, and shared selection and
replicate-specific selection components of allele frequency change. For two
replicates, $A$ and $B$, 

\begin{align}
  \Delta p_{t,A} &= \Delta_{_D} p_{t,A} + \Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,A} + \Delta_{_S} p_t \\
  \Delta p_{t,B} &= \Delta_{_D} p_{t,B} + \Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,B} + \Delta_{_S} p_t
\end{align}
%
where $\Delta_{_D} p_{t,A}$ is allele frequency change due to drift (this is
specific to a replicate, and equal to $\Delta_{_N} p_{t,A} + \Delta_{_M}
p_{t,A}$ in the notation of \cite{Buffalo2019-io}), $\Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,A}$ is
the allele frequency change from indirect selection specific to replicate $A$
(and likewise with $\Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,A}$ for replicate $B$), and $\Delta_{_S}
p_t$ is the allele frequency change from indirect selection shared across the
replicates $A$ and $B$ (this term lacks a replicate subscript since by
construction it is identical between replicates). By construction, each of
these terms is uncorrelated, so the variance and be written as:

\begin{align}
  \var(\Delta p_{t,A}) &= \var(\Delta_{_D} p_{t,A}) + \var(\Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,A}) + \var(\Delta_{_S} p_t) \\
\end{align}

The shared effects of indirect selection can be quantified from the observed
allele frequency changes, since the covariance in allele frequency change
across replicates is the covariance of the shared term by construction, 

\begin{align}
  \cov(\Delta p_{t,A}, \Delta p_{t,B}) = \cov(\Delta_{_S} p_{t}, \Delta_{_S} p_{t}) = \var(\Delta_{_S} p_{t})
\end{align}

{In artificial selection studies with a control (non-selected) line, such as the
\textcite{Castro2019-uk} study, this allows us to estimate the contribution of
the effects of shared and unique indirect selection. In the case of this study,
we can estimate the drift, unique selection effect, and shared selection effect
terms using the fact that,

\begin{align}
  \Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}} &= \Delta_{_D} p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}} + \Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}} + \Delta_{_\mathrm{LS}} p_t \\ 
  \Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}} &= \Delta_{_D} p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}} + \Delta_{_{U}} p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}} + \Delta_{_\mathrm{LS}} p_t \\ 
  \Delta p_{t,\mathrm{Ctrl}} &= \Delta_{_D} p_{t,\mathrm{Ctrl}}.
\end{align}

Note that since the control replicate does not undergo artificial selection, we
assume that its allele frequency changes are determined entirely by genetic
drift. With free mating individuals (such as in a cage population), this may
not be the case, and sequencing adjacent generations would allow one to
differentiate the effects of selection and drift.

We assume that we can approximate the contribution of genetic drift in the
Longshanks selection lines with the observed variance in the control line, or
$\var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{Ctrl}}) = \var(\Delta_{_{D} p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}}}) =
\var(\Delta_{_{D} p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}}})$. Then, the combined effects of
selection can be estimated by averaging the variances of the two Longshanks
selection lines, and subtracting the variance in allele frequency change in the
control line, which we treat as driven by drift alone (since matings are
random). Note that each variance is bias-corrected according to the methods
described in Supplementary Materials \ref{supp:matrix-correction}, and the
average sequencing depths between lines are nearly identical. Thus, we have

\begin{align}
  (\var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}}) + \var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}}))/2 - \var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{Ctrl}}) = 
  \overline{\var(\Delta_{_U} p_{t,\mathrm{LS}})} + \var(\Delta_{_\mathrm{LS}} p_t)
\end{align}
%
where the bar indicates values averaged both Longshanks selection lines.
Additionally, use the fact that

\begin{align}
  \cov(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}}, \Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}}) = \var(\Delta_{_\mathrm{LS}} p_t)
\end{align}
%
we can also separate out the unique and shared components by subtracting off
this covariance,

\begin{align}
  \overline{\var(\Delta_{_U} p_{t,\mathrm{LS}})}  = 
(\var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}}) + \var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}}))/2 - \var(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{Ctrl}}) - \cov(\Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS1}}, \Delta p_{t,\mathrm{LS2}}).
\end{align}

Finally, we can divide each of these values by the total variance to get the
proportion of total variance drift, and unique and shared effects of selection
contribute towards the total. To derive confidence intervals for the estimates
of unique and shared effects of selection, we use a block bootstrap procedure
as described in Supplementary Materials Section \ref{supp:block-bootstrap}.

\section{The Empirical Neutral Null Windowed Covariance Distribution}
\label{supp:empirical-null}

To detect an excess of genomic regions with unusually high or low covariances,
we need to compare the distribution of observed windowed covariances to a null
distribution of windowed covariances that we would expect under no selection.
While we could construct a theoretic sampling distribution of the spurious
covariances created by neutral genetic drift at particular site, the unknown
linkage disequilibrium between sites would mean that this is not an adequate
null model for the distribution of windowed covariances in our data. 

To address this limitation, we construct a neutral null model by sign-permuting
the observed allele frequency changes. This destroys the covariances built up
by selection, mimicking a neutral allele's frequency trajectory. This approach
is conservative, since selection also acts to increase the magnitude of allele
frequency changes (see equation 1 of \cite{Buffalo2019-io}), but this magnitude
is not affected by the sign-permutation procedure. Consequently, the resulting
empirical null distribution has higher variance than would be expected under
neutrality alone.

Still, we wanted to ensure that LD between sign-permuted blocks, which will
affect the variance of the empirical null distribution, does not impact our
primary finding that the distribution of temporal covariances becomes
increasingly negative in the \textcite{Barghi2019-qy} dataset through time. To
address this, we also sign-permuted at the whole chromosome level finding we
recapitulate the same pattern (Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:barghi-tailprobs-seqid}).

%Since variants have unknown dependency structure due to LD, we sign-permute at
%the window level (analogous to our block bootstrap approach). Our covariance
%statistic, $Q_{t,s} = \nicefrac{1}{L} \sum_l \Delta p_{t,l} \Delta p_{t,l}$
%(for simplicity, we drop the replicate index for clarity, do not center
%observations since their expected change is zero, and assume $|t-s| > 1$ to
%avoid the need for a bias correction) has a variance that depends on the LD:

%\begin{align}
%  \var(Q_{t,s}) &= \frac{1}{L^2} \sum_l \var(\Delta p_{t,l} \Delta p_{s,l}) + \frac{1}{L^2} \sum_{i \ne j} \cov(\Delta p_{t,i}\Delta p_{s,i}, \Delta p_{t,j}\Delta p_{s,j}) 
%\end{align}

%Under neutrality alone, we can simplify this, using the fact that allele
%frequency changes are independent through time,

%\begin{align}
%  \var(Q_{t,s}) &= \frac{1}{L^2} \sum_l \E(\Delta p_{t,l}^2) \E(\Delta p_{s,l}^2) + \frac{1}{L^2} \sum_{i \ne j} \E(\Delta p_{t,i} \Delta p_{s,i} \Delta p_{t,j} \Delta p_{t,j}) \\
%  &= \frac{1}{L^2} \sum_l \frac{p_{t,l}(1-p_{t,l}) p_{s,l}(1-p_{s,l})}{4N^2} + \\ \nonumber 
%  & \;\;\;\;\;\; \frac{1}{L^2} \sum_{i \ne j} \frac{\left(p_{s,i} p_{s,j}-4 D^2 \left(1-2 N r^2\right) \right) \left( p_{t,i} p_{t,j}-4 D^2 \left(1-2 N r^2\right) \right)}{4 N^2}
%\end{align}
%%

%where this last line can be found by assuming haplotype frequencies are sampled
%according to a Multinomial process, and recombination occurs after sampling
%(see Barton and Otto, 2005). This indicates that the variance of the covariance
%statistic, averaged over loci, depends on the linkage disequilibrium term $D^2$
%even without the presence of linked selection. However, under neutrality alone,
%the covariance statistic is unaffected by LD with sites outside averaged over.
%Still, we sign-permute loci at the chromosome level and find that the tail
%probabilities do still indicate a reverse in the direction of selection. }


\section{\textcite{Bergland2014-ij} Re-Analysis}
\label{supp:bergland-reanalysis}


We also applied our temporal covariance approach to \textcite{Bergland2014-ij},
which found evidence of genome-wide fluctuating selection between Spring and
Fall seasons across three years \emph{Drosophila melanogaster}. As described in
\textcite{Buffalo2019-io}, if fluctuating selection pressure among time-periods
are the dominant genome-wide pattern, we might expect positive covariances
between like seasons changes (e.g. Spring 2010 to Fall 2010 and Spring
2011 to Fall 2011), and negative covariances between dislike seasonal changes
(e.g. Fall 2009 to Spring 2010 and Fall 2010 to Spring 2011). However,
while we find temporal covariances that are non-zero, we find only weak support
for a seasonal fluctuating model driving these covariances. In Supplementary
Figure \ref{suppfig:bergland-covs-figure}, we show the temporal covariances
from varying reference generations, across seasonal transitions that are alike
(e.g.  the covariance between the allele frequency changes between Fall 2009
and Spring 2009, and frequency changes between Fall 2010 and Spring 2010), and
dislike (e.g. the covariance between the allele frequency change between Fall
2009 and Spring 2009, and the frequency changes between Spring 2010 and Fall
2009). The first row of temporal covariance matrix is consistent with
fluctuating selection operating for two timepoints, as the first covariance is
negative, and the second is positive, and later covariances are not
statistically differentiable from zero (which could occur if LD and additive
genetic variance decay). However, all other temporal covariances do not fit
the pattern we would expect under genome-wide fluctuating selection.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{bergland-covs-figure.pdf}

  \caption{Temporal covariances from the \textcite{Bergland2014-ij} study, from
    varying reference generations (e.g. rows along the temporal covariance
    matrix). Each covariance is labeled indicating whether the covariance is
    between two like seasonal transitions (e.g. the covariance between allele
    frequency changes from fall to spring in one year, and fall to spring in
    another) or two dislike seasons (e.g. the covariance between fall to spring
    in one year, and spring to fall in another year). Covariances between like
    transitions are expected to be positive when there is a genome-wide effect
    of fluctuating selection (and these labels are colored blue), while
    covariances between dislike transitions are expected to be negative (and
    these labels are colored red). 95\% confidence intervals were constructed
    by a block-bootstrapping procedure where the blocks are megabase tiles.}

  \label{suppfig:bergland-covs-figure}
\end{figure}

We wanted to establish that our temporal-covariance matrix bias correction was
working correctly. We find that it corrects the relationship between depth and
both variance and covariance (Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:bergland-correction}) as expected.

    due to software version differences. \textbf{B}: The histograms of the
    p-values of our reanalysis and the original \textcite{Bergland2014-ij}

    produces results very close to the original analysis.}

  \label{suppfig:bergland-pvalue-comparison}
\end{figure}


It is unclear how strong the fluctuations would have to be to generate a
genome-wide average signal of fluctuating selection from temporal covariances.
For example, many loci could still show a signal of fluctuating selection, but
the average signal could be overwhelmed by other signals of other selection. To
investigate whether there was a genome-wide excess of loci showing evidence of
fluctuating selection we reanalyzed the data of \parencite{Bergland2014-ij}
using the same seasonal fluctuating model as the original paper. This model is
a Binomial logit-linked GLM fit per-locus, where the frequencies are regressed
on the Spring/Fall seasons are encoded as a dummy variable. We use the same
binomial weighting procedure as \textcite{Bergland2014-ij}, where the weights
are determined by the effective number of chromosomes, $N_{eff} = (2 n_t d_t -
1) / (2 n_t + d_t)$ ($n_t$ and $d_t$ are the number of diploid individuals and
the read depth at timepoint $t$, respectively). We fit this model on all loci
marked as used in the VCF provided with the \textcite{Bergland2014-ij} study
(doi:10.5061/dryad.v883p). Overall, our p-values for the Wald test for each
locus closely match those of the original paper (Pearson correlation
coefficient 0.98, p-value < $2.2 \times 10^{-16}$; see Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:bergland-pvalue-comparison} A), and the histograms of the p-values
are nearly identical (Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:bergland-pvalue-comparison} B). \textcite{Bergland2014-ij} find
loci with a significant association with season after a Benjamini and Hochberg
FDR p-value adjustment \parencite{Benjamini1995-jy}, however, the null
hypothesis of the Wald test does not give us an idea of the expected number of
variants that may spuriously fit the pattern of seasonal fluctuating selection
as it does not account for genetic drift or other forms of hitchhiking.

  \label{suppfig:bergland-correction}
\end{figure}



To investigate whether there is a genome-wide evidence of an enrichment of
fluctuating selection we created an empirical null distribution by randomly
permuting the season labels and re-running the per-locus seasonal GLM model, as
proposed by \textcite{Machado2018-cs}. We find, regardless of whether we
permute at the locus-level or the permutation replicate-level, that the
observed seasonal p-value distribution \textcite{Bergland2014-ij} is not
enriched for significant p-values beyond what we would expect from the
permutation null. In fact, there appears there is more enrichment for low
p-values when seasonal labels are randomly permuted (Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:bergland-pvalue-hist}, suggesting by random chance we might expect
more variants with a seasonal fluctuating pattern than found in the original
\textcite{Bergland2014-ij} study. While surprising, this could be explained by
the presence of temporal structure across the samples not consistent with
seasonal fluctuating selection. Some fraction of the permutations happen to fit
non-seasonal structure well, leading to an enrichment of small p-values.  We
note that genetic drift is not accounted for in the model used to estimate the
significance of seasonally fluctuations and so some of these issues from
non-seasonal structure may be due to a poorly calibrated null model.
Furthermore, non-seasonal temporal structure is also evident in our temporal
covariances (Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:bergland-covs-figure}), where we
see strong evidence of selection (non-zero temporal covariances), yet the
pattern does not follow that of seasonal fluctuating selection.  


\section{Approximating the Reduction in Diversity from $G(t)$}
\label{supp:reduction-approx}

To help reconcile our measure of linked selection, $G(t)$, with familiar
expressions as a reduction in neutral diversity, as parameterized by $N_e$, we
develop some rough approximations here. Note, however, that since linked
selection generates temporal covariance, the overall effect is qualitatively
different than just a simple reduction in $N_e$, as drift alone cannot generate
temporal covariances.  First, we introduce some convenient notation. Let $V_{T}
= \var(p_t - p_0)$ be the total observed variance in allele frequency,
$C_{LS} = \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \sum_{j \ne i}^{t-1} \cov(\Delta p_i, \Delta p_j)$
be the contribution of all pairwise temporal covariances (observable), $V_D$ be
the unobservable drift-only variance in allele frequency, and $V_{LS} =
\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \var(\Delta_{LS} p_i)$ which is the (unobservable) effect
linked selection has on the variances in allele frequency change. Then,

\begin{align}
  V_{T} = V_{LS} + C_{LS} + V_D.
\end{align}
%
Our measure $G(t)$ is then,

\begin{align}
  G(t) = \frac{C_{LS}}{V_T},
\end{align}
%
meaning we can express the fraction of total variance due to drift alone as 

\begin{align}
  \frac{V_D}{V_T} &= 1 - G(t) - \frac{V_{LS}}{V_T} \\
                  &= 1 - G(t) - \varepsilon \\
                  & \le 1 - G(t),
\end{align}
%
where $\varepsilon \ge 0$ since these variances are positive. Throughout
this section, for convenience, we assume that the covariances contributing to
$C_{LS}$, and thus $G(t)$, are all positive.

Rather than expressing this relationship in terms of variances in allele
frequencies, we can express the same relationship in terms of $N_e$. In a
neutral Wright--Fisher population, the total variation in allele frequency
change over $t$ generations is

\begin{align}
  V_T = \var(p_t - p_0) = p_0(1 - p_0) \left[ 1 - (1 - \nicefrac{1}{2N_e})^t \right].
\end{align}
%
For small $t$, a common temporal estimator for the variance effective
population size $N_e$ is,

\begin{align}
  N_e \approx \frac{t p_0(1-p_0)}{2 V_T}.
\end{align}

Then, the drift-only $N_e$ estimate (that is, removing the effects of linked
selection) replaces the observable $V_T$ with unobservable $V_D$, and uses the
$G(t)$ estimate to bound this:

\begin{align}
  N_{e,D} &\approx \frac{t p_0(1-p_0)}{2 V_T(1 - G(t) - \varepsilon)} \\
          &\gtrsim  \frac{t p_0(1-p_0)}{2 V_T(1 - G(t))} \\
          &\gtrsim  \frac{N_e}{1 - G(t)} \\
  \frac{N_e}{N_{e,D}} &\lesssim  1 - G(t)
\end{align}

In the linked selection literature, it is common to translate the impact of
linked selection as a reduction in the level of neutral pairwise diversity in
the absence of linked selection, $\pi_0$. Under the coalescent, $\pi_0 = 2 \mu
\E(T_2)$ where $\E(T_2)$ is the pairwise time to coalescence, which under drift
alone in a constant population of size $N_e$, is $\E(T_2) = 2N$. The fraction of
neutral diversity (in the absence of linked selection) reduced by selection is
then, $1 - \nicefrac{\bar{\pi}}{\pi_0}$, or equivalently, $1 -
\nicefrac{N_e}{N_{e,D}}$. Then,

\begin{align}
  G(t) \lesssim 1 - \frac{N_e}{N_{e,D}},
\end{align}
which shows that our measure $G(t)$ is a lower bound, over much shorter
timescales, to the familiar measure $1 -
\nicefrac{\bar{\pi}}{\pi_{0}}$. 

\textcite{Elyashiv2016-vt} estimated that linked selection in \emph{Drosophila
  melanogaster} had resulted in a $1 - \nicefrac{\bar{\pi}}{\pi_{0}} = 77\%$
  reduction in the level of neutral diversity. Thus our estimate of $G(t)
  \approx 20\%$ in \emph{Drosophila simulans} is smaller than that seen over
long timespans in a closely related species. }


% Using another approximation, we can consider what roughly equivalently
% reduction in diversity due to background selection is expected, using the
% theory of Hudson and Kaplan (\citeyear{Hudson1994-oh},
% \citeyear{Hudson1995-xc}). Their theory states, 

% \begin{align}
%   \frac{N_e}{N_{e,D}} = \exp\left(-\frac{U}{R}\right)
% \end{align}

% where $U$ is the total genome-wide deleterious mutation rate per generation,
% and $R$ is the total recombination map length in Morgans. For \emph{Drosophila
% melanogaster} (we currently lack good estimates for \emph{D. simulans}), $R
% \approx 3$ Morgans, implying a $G(t)$ of at least 20\% implies $U \gtrsim
% 0.67$. This is entirely consistent with recent work estimating $U \approx 1.6$
% in \emph{D. melanogaster} from longer timescale population genetic data
% \parencite{Elyashiv2016-vt} (their estimate of $U$ implies a $G(t) \approx
% 0.59$, or around 59\% reduction in neutral diversity




\section{Simulation Results}
\label{supp:forward}

We conducted extensive simulations to understand how temporal covariance,
$G(t)$, and convergence correlations behave under (1) different quantitative
genetic fitness models, (2) different trait architectures (e.g. varying levels
of $V_A$ for fitness and the number of sites affecting fitness), (3) background
selection, and (4) different sampling periods. Furthermore, we use two
replicate population simulations to investigate how convergence
correlations depend on (1) the population sizes of each selection line sampled
from the main population, and (2) the direction the trait is selected on in
each line (i.e.  in the same direction, differing directions, or only one lines
elected).

Due to the high computational burden of forward simulations over this wide
breadth of parameters, we modeled a single 50 megabase region in a population
of $N = 1000$ diploid individuals with a neutral variant mutation rate of
$10^{-8}$ and a recombination rate of $10^{-8}$ per basepair. This is roughly
analogous to a quarter of an autosome of \emph{Drosophila melanogaster};
however with this small population size and mutation rate, the population
mutation rate $\theta$ for the entire region leads to far fewer neutral sites
to calculate covariances and other statistics on than expected for a region
this length in \emph{D.  melanogaster}. Since our main goal is to understand
the dynamics of statistics used in the paper and how they are affected by
different quantitative genetic fitness models, background selection, and trait
architecture, we use population frequencies rather than sampling frequencies. 

All forward simulations were conducted using SLiM \parencite{Haller2019-vu} and
run and processed using Snakemake \parencite{Koster2012-iv}; all simulation
routines are available in the Github repository
\url{https://github.com/vsbuffalo/cvtk/}.

\subsection{The Effects of the Genetic Architecture under Exponential Directional Selection}
\label{supp:genetic-arch}

We first investigated the effects of the selected trait's genetic architecture
on temporal covariances and $G(t)$ by neutrally burning in a population for
$10N$ generations, and selecting on the trait with an exponential fitness
function (where fitness of a trait value $z$ is $w(z) \propto \exp(z)$).
The exponential fitness function corresponds to multiplicative selection across
sites and so serves as the simplest directional selection model of a trait to
understand the effects of genetic architecture on the statistics we have used
in the paper.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-architecture-cov.pdf}

  \caption{The temporal covariances $\cov(\Delta p_5, \Delta p_t)$ from the
    onset of selection (generation 5) to a later time point $t$, which varies
    along the x-axis, across a variety of different initial trait additive
    genetic variances ($V_A$, columns) and number of sites contributing to the
    trait ($L$, rows). Each point is the temporal covariance averaged over 50
    replicate simulations; dark gray points are temporal covariances after the
    onset of selection, and light gray points are before. The red line is a
    loess-smoothed curve through the covariances after the onset of selection.
  Selection on the trait was imposed through an exponential fitness function.}

  \label{suppfig:sim-expfit-covs}
\end{figure}

During this burnin, sites were either marked as neutral (with mutation rate
$\mu_\mathrm{neutral} = 10^{-8}$ per gamete per generation) or contributed to
the trait's value (with mutation rate $\mu_\mathrm{trait}$), but were not
selected until generation $10N + 5$ (the five generations after burnin serve
as a neutral control). The trait mutation rate, $\mu_\mathrm{trait}$ was set by
targeting a particular architecture, the number of selected sites, $L$. Each
site contributing to the trait's value was randomly chosen to have effect size
$\pm \alpha$ with equal probability, where $\alpha$ was set to target a
particular additive genetic variance for the trait, $V_A$, for the target
number of selected sites $L$. 

Overall, we again see a finding of \textcite{Buffalo2019-io}: that the
initial expected temporal covariance conditioned on $V_A$, is invariant to the
number of loci determining the trait's value, $L$ (Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-covs}). We do find some evidence that the decay in
temporal covariance is faster when the trait has a monogenic basis (see the
third column of Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-covs}); this is
expected since the selection coefficients are larger for these monogenic
simulations, leading to faster allele frequency changes and a rapid change in
additive genetic variance. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-architecture-G.pdf}

  \caption{The $G(t)$ trajectories of 50 replicate simulations, across
    different trait architectures ($L$ is the target number of sites affecting
    the trait's value, and $V_A$ is the target trait additive genetic
    variance). The red line is the mean trajectory across all replicate
  simulations. Like Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-covs}, the
onset of selection is five generations after the $10N$ generation burnin; this
is evident by the initial flat period of the $G(t)$ trajectory.}

  \label{suppfig:sim-expfit-Gs}
\end{figure}

In our previous work, we did not investigate the affect of trait architecture
on our measure $G(t)$. Using the exponential fitness function simulations, we
also calculated $G(t)$ for each of the replicate simulations. We find that the
$G(t)$ trajectories can vary considerably across replicates depending on the
number of sites ($L$) determining the trait's value (Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-Gs}). When a trait is reasonably monogenic ($L \approx
1$), $G(t)$ trajectories vary considerably across replicate lines, as certain
lines may stochastically lose the few copies of the selected alleles (top row
of Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-Gs}). However, with a polygenic
trait, ($L \ge 100$), the $G(t)$ trajectories across replicates are similar as
each replicate contains an abundance of trait alleles (bottom rows of
Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-Gs}). Comparing the simulated
$G(t)$ replicate trajectories of Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:sim-expfit-Gs} with the \textcite{Barghi2019-qy} $G(t)$
trajectories in Figure \ref{fig:figure-1}B, we again confirm a finding of
\textcite{Barghi2019-qy}: that there is considerable genetic redundancy among
beneficial alleles, meaning because of the polygenic architecture, there
are multiple routes to adaptation. We should note that our simplified
simulation routines are slightly different from the \textcite{Barghi2019-qy}
study in that the burnin populations are all independent; however we expect the
same qualitative result.

\subsection{Temporal Covariances and $G(t)$ under Gaussian Stabilizing Selection}
\label{supp:tempcov-gss}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  selection simulations (gray lines) and the trait optima (dashed blue lines).

  per generation, while the second row shows the selection response during a
  sudden optima shift.}

  \label{suppfig:gss-zbar}
\end{figure}

Additionally, we wanted to ensure that our temporal covariances and $G(t)$
trajectories were robust to more complicated, but realistic fitness models. To
this end, we also simulated Gaussian stabilizing selection (GSS) on a trait
during burnin, followed by one of two optimum shift routines: (1) sudden optima
shifts of $\mu_\text{sudden} = \{0.1, 0.5, 1\}$, and (2) very graduate optima
shifts of $\mu_\text{gradual} = \{0.001, 0.01\}$ per generation using the same
two population simulation scheme described above (these shifts are in standard
deviations, since $V_S = 1$).  We used a polygenic architecture for these
simulations, with trait alleles assigned a $\pm 0.01$ effect size with equal
probability, trait mutation rate $10^{-8}$, and the optima shift began at five
generations after a $10N$ generation burnin.  Across our GSS simulations, we
see the expected selection response (Supplementary Material Figure
\ref{suppfig:gss-zbar}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gss-covs.pdf}

  \caption{Mean temporal covariance ($\cov(\Delta p_5, \Delta p_t)$, with $t$ varying
    across the x-axis) across 30 replicate simulations (light gray points are

    begins), under different Gaussian stabilizing selection with optima shift
  regimes. The solid red line is a loess-smoothed average of these points.}

  \label{suppfig:gss-covs}
\end{figure}

Overall, we see the same qualitative results under Gaussian stabilizing
selection with optima shifts as under exponential directional selection.
Stronger directional selection, here determined by larger sudden optima shifts
or larger gradual shifts per generation, lead to stronger temporal covariances
(Supplementary Materials Figure \ref{suppfig:gss-covs}). Furthermore, we see a
stronger effect of linked selection, as measured by $G(t)$, under stronger
directional selection (Supplementary Material Figure \ref{suppfig:gss-G}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gss-G.pdf}

  \caption{$G(t)$ trajectories across 30 replicate Gaussian stabilizing
   selection with optima shift regimes. The solid red line is a loess-smoothed
   average across replicates.}

  \label{suppfig:gss-G}
\end{figure}

Additionally, we looked at the effect of the replicate population size
drawn from the same population has on a single population's $G(t)$
trajectories. These simulations had the same $10N$ generation burnin, followed
by a change in population size emulating the bottlenecks associated with
creating selection lines. Overall, we find that smaller population sizes lead
to a reduced $G(t)$ (Supplementary Material Figure
\ref{suppfig:gss-G-sampleN}). This is expected, as the denominator of $G(t)$ is
$\var(p_t - p_0)$, which has an inverse relationship with $N_e$; as replicate
population size is reduced, the proportion of allele frequency change driven by
linked selection is lower, since the rate of drift is increased. To isolate the
effects of varying replicate population size, we also looked at just the
magnitude of temporal covariances (Supplementary Material Figure
\ref{suppfig:gss-covs-sampleN}). We find that smaller replicate population
sizes lead to \emph{larger} temporal covariances. We then looked at the initial
trait variance, which as expected, does not vary with replicate population size
(since all burnin populations had the same size). This implies that the linkage
disequilibria is higher in smaller populations, due to founder effects, which
has the effect inflating the temporal covariance as predicted by our theory
\parencite{Buffalo2019-io}.

and the light gray points are before.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Convergence Correlations}

Using the same exponential fitness function simulations described above, we
also investigated how the convergence correlation is impacted by (1) genetic
architecture, (2) the design of the selection experiment, e.g. how many
individuals are selected for each line from the founding population, and (3)
the direction of selection across the two populations ``lines". After burning
in $N = 1000$ diploid populations for $10N$ generations, we simulated two
equally-sized lines of sizes $n = \{50, 500, 1000\}$ diploids, and imposed
three selection schemes across different simulation runs. First, we imposed a
convergent selection scheme, where the populations undergo exponential
directional selection in the same direction. We expect that the convergent
correlation under this convergent scheme should be positive, as the two lines
should share some haplotypes carrying beneficial alleles, and these are
selected in the same direction across the two lines. Second, we imposed
divergent selection, where the two lines again undergo exponential directional
selection, except in different directions. Here, we expect the convergence
correlation to be negative, as haplotypes that increase the selected trait in
one population are beneficial in the upward selected line, but deleterious in
the downward selected line. Third, we have a control selection scheme, where
one line is selected and the other is not; this is akin to the control line in
the \textcite{Castro2019-uk} study (see Figure \ref{fig:figure-2}C). In this
case, we expect to see no convergence correlation, as only one line is being
selected. Finally, across these two-line simulation studies, we expect that
smaller selection line sizes should show weaker convergent correlations, as the
probability that the same haplotypes are selected between the two lines
decreases with size.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-convergence-corrs.pdf}

  \caption{The convergence correlations across the two population line
    exponential directional selection simulations; panel rows are for differing
    line population sizes, and panel columns are the modes of selection across
    the lines (convergent, divergent, and only a single selected line control).
    Line color indicates the target genetic architecture, in number of loci
    affecting the trait's value. 95\% confidence intervals are also shown. Note
    that selection begins at generation five, which is the reference
    generation; this is indicated by the split in the lines.}

  \label{suppfig:convergence-corrs}
\end{figure}

Overall, our simulations confirm our hypotheses; see Supplementary Material
Figure \ref{suppfig:convergence-corrs}. We also find that in simulations
with a monogenic genetic architecture (i.e. the target number of
trait-affecting loci is $L=1$), the convergence correlations are generally much
weaker than those under a polygenic architecture. However, this effect is
mediated by the line population size; the difference in convergence correlation
between $L = 1$ and $L = 1000$ are more dissimilar when the line population
sizes are larger (compare the first column, last two rows). Like the
convergence correlations calculated on the \textcite{Barghi2019-qy} data, we
find in simulations convergence correlations decay through time. Additionally,
populations selected in opposite directions lead to negative convergence
correlations, as expected. Overall, we find that the convergence correlation is
affected by both genetic architecture and the size of the selected population
lines.

We also wanted to test whether we see similar convergence correlations under
Gaussian stabilizing selection. In these simulations, rather than targeting a
particular $V_A$, we fix the trait mutation rate at $10^{-8}$ (thus region-wide
$\theta = 2000$). Like the exponential directional selection simulations, we
impose directional selection in the same direction across the two populations
(converge), different directions (diverge), and only in one population
(single). We also vary the type (gradual versus sudden) and magnitude of optima
shifts in the two populations. Overall, simulations show convergence
correlations for the sudden optima shifts in Supplementary Figure
\ref{suppfig:convergence-corrs-gss}. Again, optima shifts in the opposite
direction cause negative convergence correlations. We found that for slow
moving optima shifts, the convergence correlations are generally too weak to be
distinguished from zero reliably (not shown).

    sudden optima shift in standard deviations of $V_S$ 95\% confidence
  intervals are also shown. Note that selection begins at generation five,
which is the reference generation; this is indicated by the split in the

\subsection{Sampling in Temporal Blocks}
\label{supp:tempblocks}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-supp-blocks.pdf}

  \caption{A: The $G(t)$ averaged over 50 replicate simulations with $V_A =
    0.01$ and $L = 1000$. The blue line shows $G(t)$ calculated over ten
    generation blocks, similar to the calculation of temporal covariances of
    the \textcite{Barghi2019-qy} study. The red line shows the average $G(t)$
    estimates when the population is sampled every generation and all
    covariances can contribute to the numerator of $G(t)$. The dashed dark
    gray line indicates the $G'(t)$ estimate, which uses the known drift
    effective population size of the simulations. B: The temporal covariances
  calculated each generation (red line) and on ten generation blocks (blue
line) using the same simulation data.}

  \label{suppfig:supp-blocks}
\end{figure}

In our analysis of the \textcite{Barghi2019-qy} data, we describe our statistic
$G(t)$ as a lower bound for two reasons: (1) the population is sequenced every
ten generations, meaning the temporal covariances between adjacent generations
cannot contribute to the numerator of $G(t)$ but contributes to the
denominator, and (2) the estimate of $G(t)$ ignores linked selection's
contribution to the per-generation variance in allele frequency change. In
\textcite{Buffalo2019-io}, we define an alternative estimator
that includes selection's effects on these variance terms,

\begin{equation}
  G'(t) = 1 - \frac{t\E(p_0(1-p_0))}{2 {N_e}\var(p_t - p_0)},
\end{equation}
%
which can be calculated when the drift-effective population size $N_e$ can
be estimated (see equation 26 in \cite{Buffalo2019-io} for details).

To verify that $G(t)$ estimated every ten generations is indeed a lower bound,
we used a simulation procedure similar to the exponential fitness function
simulations (described in Supplementary Material Section
\ref{supp:genetic-arch}), and calculated the temporal covariances and $G(t)$
both each generation, and every ten generations. Unlike the simulations
described in \ref{supp:genetic-arch} where selection began at $10N+5$
generations, selection starts at generation $10N$ here, and used trait
$V_A = 0.01$ and targeted $L = 1000$ sites affecting the trait. 

First, comparing $G(t)$ when sampling population frequencies every generation
versus every ten generations, we confirm that the ten-generation block $G(t)$
is a lower bound of the $G(t)$ trajectory when sampling is every generation
(red and blue lines in Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-blocks}A).
Furthermore, since we control the population size and reproductive sampling
scheme in our simulations at $N = 1000$ diploids, we know the drift-effective
population size in the absence of selection, which allows us to estimate
$G'(t)$. Plugging in the drift-effective population size $N_e = 1000$ into
the expression for $G'(t)$ and using the $\var(p_t - p_0)$ calculated for
different $t$'s, we see that $G(t)$ calculated every generation does not
account for linked selection's inflation of $\var(\Delta p_t)$ and
underestimates the true impact of linked selection as expected (dashed gray
line in Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-blocks}A).

To further understand the effects of calculating temporal covariances every ten
generations rather than every generation, we also compared their magnitudes and
decay rates using the simulations described above. We find that ten generation
block temporal covariances are orders of magnitude larger but decay at similar
rates (see Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-blocks}B; note the two y-axis
scales are different). The larger magnitude is expected, as each ten generation
block temporal covariance is the sum of 45 temporal covariances between
adjacent generations (e.g. $10 \choose 2$).

\subsection{Background Selection}

In our previous work, \textcite{Buffalo2019-io}, we did not investigate whether
background selection can lead to temporal autocovariance. Here, using
forward-in-time simulations, we find that background selection can indeed
generate temporal autocovariance and lead to convergence correlations when
deleterious haplotypes are shared between populations and both are removed by
selection. 

We simulated background selection in a 50 megabase region, where deleterious
alleles are randomly introduced by mutation. Following background selection
literature
\parencite{Charlesworth1993-gb,Nordborg1996-nq,Hudson1994-oh,Hudson1995-xc}, we
parameterize the mutation rate as the total number of deleterious mutations
introduced per diploid genome, per generation, and simulate values $U = \{0.5,
1.0, 1.5\}$. Note that for our 50Mb region, our choice of BGS $U$ parameters
are on the higher end of the spectrum expected for \emph{Drosophila}, but we
wanted to ensure the strength was sufficient to see a signal. Note that if $U
\approx 1.6$ \parencite{Elyashiv2016-vt}, and the \emph{Drosophila} genome is
$\approx 140$Mb, our region is $\approx 36\%$ of the genome; this implies a
reasonable $U$ for our region is $U \approx 0.57$, which is close to the bottom
end of our parameter range. We also vary the strength of selection against the
deleterious mutations, $s = \{0.01, 0.05, 0.1\}$, as well as different
recombination rates ($r_{bp} = \{10^{-7}, 10^{-8}\}$).  Like other simulations,
we burnin the population for $10N$ generations under backgrounds selection.
Overall, we find background selection does create temporal covariance
(Supplementary Material Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-bgs-covs}), which are stronger
under (1) higher deleterious mutation rates and (2) larger selection
coefficients. This latter point initially seems at odds with background
selection theory, as the level of pairwise diversity in a region under strong
background selection is invariant with respect to the selection coefficient.
However, looking at the background selection $G(t)$ trajectories, we find that
over time, background selection appears to trend towards an asymptote in
the $r_{BP} = 10^{-7}$ subfigure, and reaches an equilibrium in the $r_{BP} =
10^{-8}$ subfigure that seems reasonably invariant to the choice of $s$
(Supplementary Material Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-bgs-g-fix}). We believe that
these observations can be reconciled by $Cov(\Delta p_t,~ \Delta
p_{t^{\prime}})$ being larger for larger $s$ when $|t^{\prime}-t|$ is small,
but also decaying more rapidly with $|t^{\prime}-t|$, such that the overall
contribution of selection to allele frequency variance is invariant to $s$ (for
strong background selection).  However, further work is needed to fully explore
and understand the temporal covariance dynamics of background selection.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-bgs-G-with-fixations.pdf}

  \caption{The trajectories of $G(t)$ through time under background selection,

    fixes $U = 1.0$, and $s$ varies, while in the second column $s=0.05$
    is held constant, and $U$ varies. $G(t)$ is calculated using both
  including fixed sites (solid lines) and not including fixed sites (dashed
lines).}

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-bgs-covars-without-fixations.pdf}

  \caption{The temporal covariances, $\cov(\Delta p_{50}, \Delta p_t)$ (where
    $t$ varies along the x-axis) created by background selection, under
    different recombination rates ($r_{BP}$, rows), selection coefficients
    ($s$), and deleterious mutation rates ($U$). Unlike directional selection
    figures, where we choose the reference generation to be the first
    generation after the onset of selection, here we choose an arbitrary
    reference generation (generation 50). The symmetry of temporal covariance
    around the reference generation, is expected, since unlike directional
    selection the level of additive genetic variance for fitness has hit
    mutation-selection-drift balance. Note that the first column sets constant
  $U = 1.0$, and $s$ varies, while the second column sets $s=0.05$ constant,
and varies $U$.}

  \label{suppfig:supp-bgs-covs}
\end{figure}

Additionally, we investigated whether background selection can create
convergence correlations between two replicate populations. Much like the
exponential directional selection and Gaussian stabilizing selection
simulations, we burned in a population for $10N$ generations with background
selection, which continued after the population was split into two replicate
populations. These simulations fixed $U = 1.0$, $r_{BP} = 10^{-8}$, and varied
the replicate population size $n = \{200, 1000\}$. We find that background
selection can create convergence correlations (Supplementary Material Figure
\ref{suppfig:supp-bgs-converg}). We find the convergence correlation is weaker
in smaller replicate population sizes, as there are fewer shared haplotypes
carrying the same deleterious alleles between the two populations.

Finally, we found in processing these background selection simulation
results that including or excluding sites fixed or lost through time can lead
to differences in the estimated $G(t)$ trajectories and temporal covariance. We
discuss this extensively in a subsequent section, Supplementary Materials
Section \ref{supp:fixation}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig-bgs-convergence-correlation.pdf}

  \caption{The convergence correlation created by background selection through
    time, since the population split. The replicate population size varies
    between the two panels. Values are averaged over 30 replicate simulations,
    while the interval is a 95\% confidence interval.}

  \label{suppfig:supp-bgs-converg}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Truncation Selection} 

We also explored how directional truncation selection generates temporal
covariances. In these simulations we select the top 10\%, 25\%, or 50\% of the
phenotypic distribution of individuals to form the next generation. We burnin
these simulations using a neutral burnin routine, where trait alleles are
selectively neutral until directional selection is imposed. More extreme
directional truncation selection generated larger initial covariances
(Supplementary Material Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-trunc}B).  However, weaker
truncation selection generated more sustained positive covariances and so
have a larger long-term impact on the variance in allele frequency change.
We again noticed fixation or loss of sites has a strong effect on temporal
covariance and $G(t)$ under truncation selection.  Here, since only a
(potentially small) fraction of individuals contribute to the next generation,
sites can fix over very short timescales.  Furthermore, the small number of
effective breeders contributing to the next generation shrinks $N_e$
considerably, which increases $\var(p_t - p_0)$, the denominator of $G(t)$. We
see both the effect of handling fixed/lost sites differently and the faster
rate of drift in Supplementary Materials Figure \ref{suppfig:supp-trunc}A,
where weaker truncation selection actually has higher levels of $G(t)$. Looking
just at temporal covariances, we find that stronger truncation selection (e.g.
a smaller tail of individuals selected) does lead to greater temporal
covariances. Overall, these truncation selection simulations demonstrate the
value of considering both absolute measures of selection's effect on allele
frequency changes, i.e. temporal covariance, as well as measures relative to
drift, i.e. the $G(t)$ trajectories. While selecting a smaller tail of
individuals is associated with \emph{stronger} selection, it also is leading to
a faster rate of drift, which can distort conclusions inferred from considering
the $G(t)$ trajectories alone.

    solid lines exclude fixed sites. All values are averaged over 30 replicate
    simulations; the lines in the right figure are loess smoothed, while points
    are averages. The solid lines of the temporal covariances have been
    excluded in the left figure for clarity, but are similar except they do not
    become negative.}

    \label{suppfig:supp-trunc}
\end{figure}




\subsection{The Effect of Fixations in the Empirical Datasets}
\label{supp:fixation}

In our simulation results, we noticed the temporal covariances and $G(t)$
statistics can differ depending on how allele frequencies of zero or one are
handled. Generally, temporal covariances should be calculated on polymorphic
sites; once a site has reached fixation or loss, its allele frequency change
$\Delta p_t = 0$ and including these sites in the temporal covariance
calculation can lead to biases. However, with \emph{sample} allele frequencies,
rather than population frequencies, a site with observed frequency zero or one
may still be segregating, but by chance not sampled at a timepoint. Here, we
discuss the effect of including sites with frequency zero or one, and show our
empirical results are not qualitatively different when analyzed excluding fixed
sites.

With empirical data calculated on sample allele frequencies, low frequency
minor alleles may not be sampled at some timepoints, and excluding these
observations (instead of treating it as a trajectory that has a 0 frequency
timepoint) biases estimates of quantities such as $N_e$ towards intermediate
frequency alleles. Additionally, we tried only dropping fixed or loss sites
from the temporal covariance calculations that were at the end or the beginning
of a trajectory (e.g., as if the site was created by a new mutation or fixed);
while this ameliorated some of this bias it did not remove all of it. Overall,
we found by trying all these approaches that not removing fixed or lost sites
was the best way to deal with sample allele frequencies that could be missing
from some timepoints.

To ensure that our findings were robust to handling sites with a frequency of
zero or one differently, we regenerated Figures \ref{fig:figure-1} and Figure
\ref{fig:figure-3} but excluded frequencies of zero or one. Specifically, we
wanted to ensure that our finding that temporal covariances were negative at
later timepoints was not spuriously caused by the way fixed or lost sites are
handled. We see no qualitative difference (Supplementary Material Figures
\ref{suppfig:supp-fig-1-nofix} and \ref{suppfig:supp-fig-3-nofix}) that emerges
when sites with frequency zero or one are excluded.

covariances at more distant timepoints ($k=2$). }

\subsection{Bias Correction for \textcite{Barghi2019-qy}}

We have investigated the effectiveness of our correction on real data by
exploiting the relationship between sampling depth and the magnitude of the
variance and covariance biases, and comparing the observed variances and
covariances before and after correction. We plot the variance and covariance
(between adjacent time intervals) before and after the bias correction against
the average sample depth in 100kb genomic windows in Figure
\ref{suppfig:barghi-correction}. Overall, we find the biased-correction
procedure removes the relationship between variance and covariance and depth,
indicating it is working adequately.

Here we report median and trimmed mean of the windowed covariances
(Supplementary Table \ref{supp:table-trimmed-mean}). We note that the median
covariance is also limiting result of a trimmed mean that symmetrically
excludes the upper and lower $\alpha$ tails to calculate the trimmed average
windowed covariance. As $\alpha$ increases to 0.5, the trimmed covariance
converges to the median windowed covariance (by the definition of the median;
see Supplementary Figure \ref{suppfig:barghi-trimmed-mean}). Thus our genomic
temporal covariances are non-zero due to the impact of selection on many
genomic windows.

    average window covariance, excluding the $\alpha$ lower and upper tails,
    converges to the median windowed covariance. This indicates that
  genome-wide covariances are not being overly dominated by a large-effect loci
in few windows.}

  \caption{We chose number of bins used in the histograms of Figure
    \ref{fig:figure-3} via an analytic expression for the cross-validation
    risk, based on the equation 6.16 of (\cite{Wasserman2006-jl}, p. 129).
    Above, we plot the cross-validation risk for various numbers of bins, for
    each of the four off-diagonals of the temporal covariance matrix that we
    analyze. Overall, because the number of data points is large, oversmoothing
    is less of a problem, leading the cross-validation risk to be relatively
    flat across a large number of bins. Each gray point indicates the minimal
    risk for a particular off-diagonal, and the dashed line indicates the best
    average binwidth across off-diagonals.}
